=================

This is a list of scripts I created while working at Drexel University.

# ./bin/

This is user bin scripts I put in my ~/bin directory.

# ./live_trends

I wrote a set of scripts to record live performance data of a system
using simple bash scripts (or any language).  I did this because I
needed something which was better than munin as munin only recorded
once every 5 minutes.
