# ./appserver-scripts/

Some of these scripts help me automate deployments to app servers.

# ./bin/

This is user bin scripts I put in my ~/bin directory.

# ./dotfiles/

Some common dotfiles which I personally like to customize.

# ./icinga/

Lists some Nagios/Icinga scripts which I maintain and use within our monitoring system, Icinga.

# ./init.d/

These are a set of service/daemon scripts I wrote for different software.
Things like tomcat startup scripts and JBoss startup scripts (or any software)
will be in here.

# ./live_trends/

I wrote a set of scripts to record live performance data of a system
using simple bash scripts (or any language).  I did this because I
needed something which was better than munin as munin only recorded
once every 5 minutes.

# ./munin/

Scripts which I've written or maintained for munin monitoring at Drexel.  We use munin for performance trending.
